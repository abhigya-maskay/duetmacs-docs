- Session Metadata: Titles/tags for organization; export transcripts.
- Status/Progress: Streaming outputs and progress in minibuffer/echo area.

## Context & Prompting
- Context Ingestion: Send region, buffer, files, or project subsets.
- Project Scopes: Restrict by root, subdir, globs, or file types.
- Structured Prompts: Presets for refactor, explain, tests, docs, review.
